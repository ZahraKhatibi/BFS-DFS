## Implemented Algorithms

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root node and explores the neighbor nodes first before moving to the next level. BFS is often used for tasks such as finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs and network analysis.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)

DFS is another graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It's commonly used for topological sorting, cycle detection, and solving puzzles like mazes. DFS has applications in various domains, including artificial intelligence and data mining.
